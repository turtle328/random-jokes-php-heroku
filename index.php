// I. define some constants
define('MIN_LIMIT', 1);
define('MAX_LIMIT', 10);


// II. $jokes contains our data
// this is an indexed array of associative arrays
// the associative arrays are jokes -  they have an 'q' key and an 'a' key
$jokes = [
    ["q" => "What do you call a very small valentine?", "a" => "A valen-tiny!!!"],
    ["q" => "What did the dog say when he rubbed his tail on the sandpaper?", "a" => "Ruff, Ruff!!!"],
    ["q" => "Why don't sharks like to eat clowns?", "a" => "Because they taste funny!!!"],
    ["q" => "What did the boy cat say to the girl cat?", "a" => "You're Purr-fect!!!"],
    ["q" => "What is a frog's favorite outdoor sport?", "a" => "Fly Fishing!!!"],
    ["q" => "I hate jokes about German sausages.", "a" => "Theyre the wurst!!!"],
    ["q" => "Did you hear about the cheese factory that exploded in France?", "a" => "There was nothing left but de Brie!!!"],
    ["q" => "Our wedding was so beautiful ", "a" => "Even the cake was in tiers!!!"],
    ["q" => "Is this pool safe for diving?", "a" => "It deep ends!!!"],
    ["q" => "Dad, can you put my shoes on?", "a" => "I dont think theyll fit me!!!"],
    ["q" => "Can February March?", "a" => "No, but April May!!!"],
    ["q" => "What lies at the bottom of the ocean and twitches?", "a" => "A nervous wreck!!!"],
    ["q" => "Im reading a book on the history of glue.", "a" => "I just cant seem to put it down!!!"],
    ["q" => "Dad, can you put the cat out?", "a" => "I didnt know it was on fire!!!"],
    ["q" => "What did the ocean say to the sailboat?", "a" => "Nothing, it just waved!!!"],
    ["q" => "What do you get when you cross a snowman with a vampire?", "a" => "Frostbite!!!"]
];


// III. Sanitize the `limit` parameter to be sure that it is numeric, and is not too small or large
$limit = MIN_LIMIT; // the default
if (array_key_exists('limit', $_GET)) { // if there is a `limit` parameter in the query string
    $limit = $_GET['limit'];
    $limit = (int)$limit; // explicitly cast value to an integer
    $limit =  ($limit < 1) ? MIN_LIMIT : $limit; // PHP has a ternary operator too
    $limit =  ($limit > MAX_LIMIT) ? MAX_LIMIT : $limit; // PHP has a ternary operator too
}


// IV. Do a final check that there are enough jokes in the $jokes array
if ($limit > count($jokes)) {
    $limit = count($jokes);
}


// V. get a random element of the $jokes array
// there are a bunch more PHP array functions at: http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php
// https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.shuffle.php
// https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-push.php
$randomKeys = array_keys($jokes); // creates an array of indexes - something like [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...]
shuffle($randomKeys); // randomizes the $randomKeys array - something like [1,5,3,2,0,8,4,7,6, ...]
$randomKeys = array_slice($randomKeys, 0, $limit); // just get the first `n` number of indexes we need
$randomJokes = []; // the random jokes will go here
foreach ($randomKeys as $key) { // loop through $randomKeys
    array_push($randomJokes, $jokes[$key]); // add a random joke to the array
}


// VI. Send HTTP headers
// https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
// DO THIS **BEFORE** you `echo()` the content!
header('content-type:application/json');                  // tell the requestor that this is JSON
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');                 // turn on CORS
header('X-author-name: alex');
header('X-this-430-service-is-kinda-lame: true');   // a custom header 


// VII. Send the content
// json_encode() turns a PHP associative array into a string of well-formed JSON
// https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
$string = json_encode($randomJokes);
echo $string;
